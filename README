What is SpyJar??


* DBSP/SPGen

These are classes which are used to generate java classes for sql
statements from template files.  Since much of the work of setting and
getting variables, all the way to documentation is duplicated every step
along the way, the template files allow for code generation to occur in a
systematically standard way.

SPGen takes care of converting the .spt files into java classes (DBPSs)
through the use of an Ant target.  From here, the DBSP is compiled and made
accessible through configuration, without the need to require connections
directly from a pool.  Much less code is required for using the DBSP
classes.



* Saver/Savable

Saver takes the DBSPs and turns multiples of DBSP calls into a single
transation.  Saver then can continue to go a step further and assure that
and child objects are then saved in the single transaction as well.  Care
should be taken to assure that a dead locking issue does not occur on the
backend database.

Saver, much like DBSP, takes only a configuration object to handle the
atomic sql execution.  Saver will take care of getting a connection,
starting a transaction on it, and then calling the chain of objects for
saving and calling their appropriate DBSPs.

Any object which implements the Savable interface can make use of the Saver
transaction management.  Saver will start by determining if the object has
changed, and if it has, then the Saver object call the object's save method
so the object can save itself.  will find all child objects requiring
saving as well.  Next, the getSavables method will be called to find out
what dependent objects need to be saved, and the process will repeat for
each dependent object.  Saver works well in saving object that have
associations which much be saved at once.  A good example would be an order
in an order processing system, where the header and line item details much
be saved atomically, or not at all.
